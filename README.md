# maths_and_stats
Building on previous repositories, this collection of python files present a series of maths questions to attempt.  There are question on all the 7 basic arithmetic operators 
in python, plus rounding, binary conversion, and some basic statistics questions.  All accessed through a serious of menus.  

Run the TopLevelMenu.py file to access all other menus.

This is intended as a demo project to showcase my Python ability.  Any question, UK job offers etc... email me on daniel_stevenson@hotmail.com.
